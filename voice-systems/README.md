```

### 1. Simple Interaction Flow

**User**: "Tell me about the files in the current directory"

**Claude**: 
1. Executes `ls` command
2. OpenAI Realtime API provides immediate voice report
3. "The current directory contains X files..."

### 2. Command Execution Flow

**User**: "Create a new directory"

**Claude**:
1. Launches command permission system
   ```
   üîê Checking command execution permission...
   üìù Command: mkdir new-project
   üìÑ Description: Create new project directory
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Not in whitelist

   ```

2. **User responds with voice**: "Python"

3. **System**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Voice recognition: Python execution selected
   üêç Executing command with Python...
   ‚úÖ Command execution successful

```

## CLAUDE.md Configuration Examples

Place `CLAUDE.md` at the project root to customize Claude Code behavior.

### Basic CLAUDE.md Example

```markdown
# Claude Code Settings for [Project Name]

## Notification Rules
**Required**: Voice notifications must be sent for all task completions without exception.

### Task-Specific Sound Templates

#### 1. File Edit Complete
osascript -e 'display notification "üìù File edited: [filename]" with title "Claude Code" sound name "Tink"'

#### 2. Build Complete
osascript -e 'display notification "üî® Build complete" with title "Claude Code" sound name "Hero"'

#### 3. Test Complete
osascript -e 'display notification "‚úÖ Tests completed ([result])" with title "Claude Code" sound name "Glass"'

#### 4. Search/Analysis Complete
osascript -e 'display notification "üîç Search/Analysis complete" with title "Claude Code" sound name "Ping"'

#### 5. Installation/Setup Complete
osascript -e 'display notification "üì¶ Installation/Setup complete" with title "Claude Code" sound name "Funk"'

#### 6. Daily Conversation/Simple Response
osascript -e 'display notification "üí¨ Response complete" with title "Claude Code" sound name "Pop"'

### Scenarios Requiring Notifications (All Mandatory)
- After file editing completion
- After long-running processes completion (10+ seconds)
- After build or test execution completion
- After package installation completion
- After multiple file processing completion
- After error fixing completion
- After user request completion
- After configuration file updates
- After search/analysis completion
- After command execution completion
- **After ALL task completions**

## Voice Notification Rules
### Situation-Based TTS Usage

#### OpenAI Realtime API (Simple Interaction & Immediate Response)
**Usage Scenarios**:
- Simple question responses
- Content that can be answered immediately
- Short-duration responses
- Interactive exchanges

**Features**:
- Ultra-fast voice synthesis (Shimmer voice)
- Volume adjusted to 50%
- Streaming playback with error recovery functionality

**Usage Examples**:
python voice-systems/openai-realtime/openai_realtime_test.py "Response content"

#### Gemini TTS (Complex Tasks & Process Completion Notifications)
**Usage Scenarios**:
- File creation/editing completion
- Multi-step process completion
- Long-running process completion notifications
- Complex task completion reports

**Features**:
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS
- Zephyr voice model
- Natural, human-like speech

**Usage Examples**:
python voice-systems/gemini-tts/quick_tts_test.py "File editing complete"
python voice-systems/gemini-tts/quick_tts_test.py "Build complete"
python voice-systems/gemini-tts/quick_tts_test.py "Test execution complete"

## Command Execution Rules
**Required**: Command permission system must be used before all Bash command execution.

### Full-Featured Version (Voice Recognition) [Recommended]
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "<command>" "<clear Japanese description>"

### Simple Version
python voice-systems/command-permission/simple_command_permission.py "<command>" "<clear Japanese description>"

**Without exception, use this system before using Claude Code's Bash tools.**

### New Feature: Execution Method Selection
The command permission system provides the following options:

1. **[P] Python Execution** - Direct execution within script
   - Immediate execution and result confirmation
   - Voice completion notifications
   - Voice feedback on errors

2. **[C] Claude Execution** - Execute via Claude Code (traditional method)
   - Execute through Claude Code tools
   - Safer execution environment

3. **[N] Do Not Execute** - Cancel
   - Cancel command execution

### Usage Examples and Workflow

#### Safe Commands (In Whitelist)
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "git status" "Check Git status"
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "ls -la" "List directory contents"
‚Üí Light notification sound only, showing approved status

#### Dangerous Commands (Not in Whitelist)
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "rm -rf old_files" "Delete old files"
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "npm install express" "Install Express package"
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "git push origin main" "Push to main branch"
‚Üí Warning sound + voice "Not in whitelist. Execute [description]?"

### Second Argument Guidelines
The second argument should contain **Japanese description that will be read aloud as-is**:

#### Good Examples
- "Delete old files"
- "Install Express package"
- "Create database backup"
- "Compress log files"
- "Restart development server"

#### Examples to Avoid
- "Execute rm -rf old_files" (Too technical)
- "File deletion command" (Vague)
- "dangerous operation" (English)

### [Strict Adherence] Execution Flow
1. **Required**: python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "command" "description" check
2. Wait for voice confirmation if not in whitelist
3. **Then**: Execute actual command with Claude Code Bash tools
4. Complete

### Important Notes
- **Direct Bash command execution in Claude Code is prohibited**
- **Command permission system must be executed first**
- **There are no exceptions to this rule**

### Prohibited Actions
‚ùå Direct execution like Bash(tree voice-systems)
‚ùå Skipping command permission system
‚ùå Ignoring rules for "emergency" reasons

‚úÖ Correct procedure:
1. python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "tree voice-systems" "Check directory structure"
2. After voice confirmation completion, execute Bash(tree voice-systems)
```
